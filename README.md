# DocuMind â€” Document Q&A with LangChain + Gemini

DocuMind is a Streamlit app that lets you upload PDF, DOCX, and TXT files, builds a FAISS vector store over document chunks (with `source` + `page` metadata), and uses Google Gemini to answer questions grounded in your documents. When answers are based on document content, DocuMind includes citations like `(file.pdf - page 3)` and shows a small source list in the UI.
