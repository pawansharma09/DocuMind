# DocuMind: RAG Chatbot with Gemini & Streamlit

DocuMind is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built with Python. It allows users to upload multiple documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and ask questions about their content through a user-friendly chat interface created with Streamlit.

The backend is powered by LangChain, using Hugging Face embeddings for document vectorization and Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash model for question-answering. The vector search is handled efficiently by FAISS. This project is structured with modularity in mind, making it suitable for a capstone project or further development.
